# Stock Selection using Machine Learning Techniques

## Summary
Purpose of this analysis is to predict 1-month stock returns of securities in CSI 300. Based on predicted returns performance, each stock will be assigned to different performance categories. Stocks with good performance will be picked and invested at the end of the month.

This process will repeat every month and the strategy will be backtested to determine with whether the prediction model is good enough for consistent outperformance over the index/benchmark.
